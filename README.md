### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Ashwathi Pillai (she/her) and I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science and AI for the Creative Industries at the University of the Arts London. I have a multidisciplinary background - I started my career path with a Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration, and worked in Marketing, Finance, and UX Research roles for about five years. In my current projects, I'm focused on music and accessibility for disabled users while building solutions. 

When I'm not working, I really enjoy sketching, reading philosophy, curating [Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/w7iydxkqga5ljab2c7smt3wic), taking photographs of pretty places / people, and writing poetry. Get in touch if you'd like to discuss a project, or just chat about anything!
